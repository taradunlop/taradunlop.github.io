**Context**

This application is used by members to access information about their health plan for themselves and their dependents.

**Summary**

Our member portal was out of date and needed a style refresh. In addition to this, over the years features and tools had been added without consideration to the user experience.

Our goals were to give the users a more modern feeling experience, ease their way in accessing the information they were coming to us for, and to simplify the structure of the portal in a way that made it easier for the product and development teams to maintain.


**Platform**

The member portal uses the HealthTrio content management system (CMS), which is a vendor who specializes in healthcare systems. The content is created in their CMS using HTML and CSS, and driven by their categorization system.

**Duration of project**

Work began in January of 2021 and was completed in July of 2022.

**Process**

We began with research in how users currently used the portal, primarily using anaytics from the vendor (HealthTrio) and Google Analytics. We also had survey data from  users on their opinions of and challenges with the the site.

This information was used to prioritize frequently accessed and desired features and tools in the design, as well as to remove unneccessary features and declutter the home screen.

Extensive documentation was done on the current state of the portal, the goals of the project, and supporting documentation for the redesign prototypes.
