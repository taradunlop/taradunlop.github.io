## Context

This webpage was created to allow health plan administrators to look up and download pricing files as part of a compliance regulation.

## Summary

The current solution was a static list on a marketing page that only displayed a limited number of files. In order to be in compliance with federal regulations, we needed to make all files available online, and since we had thousands of files a static list was not reasonable.

Our goal was to create a webpage where users could search by name or EIN to locate and download their pricing files.


## Platform

This page was created internally by our development team and hosted on AWS.

## Duration of project

Work began in April of 2023 and was completed in June of 2023.

## Process

Evaluation of the previous solution was done and business requirement were gathered by the business analyst. We worked together to come up with a design that would utilize the API created by the architecture team. The design was reviewed by stakeholders, developed by the portal team, and went through a round of UAT prior to launch.
