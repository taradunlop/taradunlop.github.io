## Context

There was a lack of transparency into the applications supported by the development team and the business stakeholders in the organization outside of the information services department. Documentation prior to this had largely been restricted to spaces accessible only to development teams.

## Summary

A SharePoint site that was accessible to the entire organization was created to provide context and details about applications supported by the development team.

This is an ongoing project where applications are added to the SharePoint site as major updates are made or new applications are created.

## Platform

Documentation and supplemental articles are published in SharePoint.

## Duration of project

Work began in September of 2022 and is ongoing.

## Outputs

- SharePoint site
- Confluence organization

## Outcomes of project

In addition to the orginal goal of creating more awareness in the organization, the team found that the SharePoint site was also useful for publishing Frequently Asked Question pages and How To Guides for end users.
