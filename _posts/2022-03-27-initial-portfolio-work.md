I began work on this a few weeks ago, but progress stalled due to a need to focus on other areas. 

The initial checklist of what needs to be done includes:

About me
- Name
- Dates of work
- My story
	- Who I am
	- My interests and strengths
	- Special skils
- Contact information

Curated work, displayed by project
- Context
	- Summary
	- Problem statement
	- Team
	- Role
	- Platform (what it was designed for)
	- Duration of project
	- Challenges
- Process
	- Research done
	- In progress artifacts and their relevance
- Outputs
- Outcomes of project
